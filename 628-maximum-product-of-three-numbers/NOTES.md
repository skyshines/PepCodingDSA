Approach1
1.find 3 max no and multiply--> will only work for positive numbers
for -ve number since two -ve mutiplied will be positive,we have to consider that too
​
Algorithm
result = max(min1 * min2 , max2 * max3) * max 1;
​
min1 , min 2 will have the least two negative numbers in the array
max1 max2 max3 will have the largest numbers in the array
